# LiveTemplate v1.0 Roadmap: Update Generation First

## Correct Priority Order

**Primary Goal**: Fast and efficient update generation (75-80% Strategy 1 success rate)
**Secondary Goal**: Secure multi-tenant architecture for production scale

### Why This Order Matters

If update generation doesn't achieve target bandwidth efficiency, there's no point building security around an inefficient system. Security is only valuable if the core functionality delivers exceptional performance.

## Phase 1: Core Update Generation (Tasks 1-40)
**Must Pass Gate**: Prove 75-80% static/dynamic success rate with 85-95% bandwidth reduction

### Core Components (Priority Order):
1. **HTML Diffing Engine** - Accurate change pattern analysis
2. **Static/Dynamic Generator** - Strategy 1 with empty state handling 
3. **Marker Compiler** - Strategy 2 for position-discoverable changes
4. **Granular Operations** - Strategy 3 for simple structural changes
5. **Fragment Replacement** - Strategy 4 fallback for complex changes
6. **Strategy Selector** - HTML diff-based intelligent selection

### Success Criteria (Gate to Phase 2):
- ✅ 85-95% size reduction for text-only changes (Strategy 1) 
- ✅ 75-80% of templates successfully use Strategy 1
- ✅ >90% strategy selection accuracy through HTML diff analysis
- ✅ P95 update generation latency <75ms (includes HTML diffing)
- ✅ Single-user proof of concept works flawlessly

## Phase 2: Production Security (Tasks 41-60)
**Only After Phase 1 Success**: Scale the proven efficient system securely

### Security Components:
1. **Multi-tenant Application Isolation** - JWT-based separation
2. **Page Lifecycle Management** - Thousands of concurrent pages
3. **Memory Management** - Resource limits and cleanup
4. **Operational Monitoring** - Metrics, health checks, logging

### Success Criteria:
- ✅ Zero cross-application data leaks
- ✅ Support 1,000 concurrent pages per instance
- ✅ Memory usage bounded under multi-tenant load
- ✅ 99.9% uptime in staging environment

## Critical Implementation Rule

**NO SECURITY WORK** begins until Phase 1 achieves all performance targets. An inefficient but secure system is worthless - we need an efficient system first, then make it secure.

## Expected Timeline with LLM-Assisted Development

- **Phase 1**: 4-6 weeks (update generation focus)
- **Phase 2**: 2-3 weeks (security implementation)
- **Total**: 6-9 weeks to production-ready v1.0

This priority order ensures we solve the hard problem (efficient updates) first, then the easier problem (scaling securely).

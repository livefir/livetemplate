## Description

Implement comprehensive API improvements based on user feedback to enhance naming consistency, method clarity, and public interface design

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Main type renamed from StateTemplate to Renderer to avoid redundant statetemplate.StateTemplate naming
- [ ] Method renamed from PushData to RenderData to clearly indicate both data pushing and fragment rendering operations
- [ ] New() function explicitly accepts *html.Template to clarify template system compatibility
- [ ] SessionStore interface made public to allow custom implementations
- [ ] SessionData struct simplified for store implementers by removing non-storage concerns
- [ ] Performance target updated to support 10000+ concurrent sessions
- [ ] All documentation updated to reflect new API design
- [ ] All usage examples updated with new method names and type names
- [ ] API clearly separates initial page loads (NewSession) from real-time updates (GetSession + RenderData)

## Implementation Notes

Implemented all API refinements based on user feedback. Key changes: 1) Renamed StateTemplate to Renderer to avoid redundant naming (statetemplate.Renderer instead of statetemplate.StateTemplate), 2) Renamed PushData to RenderData to clearly indicate both data pushing and fragment rendering, 3) Made New() explicitly accept *html.Template for clarity, 4) Made SessionStore interface public with simplified SessionData struct for custom implementations, 5) Updated performance target to 10,000+ concurrent sessions, 6) Updated all documentation, examples, and sequence diagrams throughout SESSION_DESIGN.md to reflect new API. All tests pass and design is ready for implementation.

## Description

Rewrite SESSION_DESIGN.md following engineering best practices with clear problem definition, functional specification, and technical implementation layers

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Document follows three-layer structure (Problem Definition
- [ ] Functional Specification
- [ ] Technical Specification)
- [ ] Layer 1 clearly defines problem statement with goals and non-goals
- [ ] Layer 2 describes functional behavior and API design with alternative approaches considered
- [ ] Layer 3 provides technical implementation details with architecture diagrams
- [ ] Reference implementation included with working code examples
- [ ] Clear logical flow between sections with each layer building on the previous
- [ ] Design decisions explicitly justified with trade-offs explained
- [ ] Document structured for engineering audience with precise technical language
- [ ] All existing design improvements maintained (API naming
- [ ] performance targets
- [ ] etc.)

## Implementation Notes

Completely restructured SESSION_DESIGN.md following the three-layer engineering design pattern. Layer 1 (Problem Definition) clearly articulates the current singleton renderer limitations, functional/non-functional requirements, and stakeholder needs. Layer 2 (Functional Specification) defines system behavior with two operational modes (initial page load vs real-time updates), comprehensive API design, user flows with sequence diagrams, and detailed analysis of alternative approaches. Layer 3 (Technical Specification) provides complete implementation architecture with component diagrams, data flow, core types, security implementation, performance optimizations, and configuration strategies. Added comprehensive reference implementation with working Go code example, HTML templates, and JavaScript client handling. Maintained all previous API improvements while creating a logical, reviewable flow that builds systematically from problem to solution. Document now serves as a complete technical specification ready for implementation.

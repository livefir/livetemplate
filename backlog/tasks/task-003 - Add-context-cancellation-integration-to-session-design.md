## Description

Clarify how HTTP request context cancellation automatically terminates sessions for better resource management and client disconnect handling

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] NewSession accepts context.Context parameter (typically http.Request.Context())
- [ ] Session automatically terminates when provided context is cancelled
- [ ] Session.Updates() channel closes immediately on context cancellation
- [ ] Background goroutines are terminated to prevent leaks
- [ ] Session struct includes context fields (ctx and cancelFunc)
- [ ] Channel lifecycle documentation explains automatic cleanup behavior
- [ ] Reference implementation shows proper usage with r.Context()
- [ ] Key validation points include context integration verification
- [ ] Documentation clearly explains when sessions terminate (client disconnect timeouts network failures etc.)

## Implementation Notes

Enhanced SESSION_DESIGN.md to fully integrate context cancellation behavior. Key additions: 1) Updated Session Lifecycle Management section with detailed Context-Based Session Termination flow, 2) Added context fields (ctx, cancelFunc) to Session struct definition, 3) Enhanced Channel Lifecycle documentation explaining automatic closure on context cancellation, 4) Updated reference implementation with clear comment about r.Context() usage for automatic cleanup, 5) Added context integration to Key Validation Points. The design now clearly specifies that when http.Request.Context() is passed to NewSession(), the session automatically terminates if the client disconnects, request times out, or connection is terminated, providing automatic resource cleanup and preventing memory leaks from abandoned sessions.

## Description

Implement core HTML diffing engine to analyze changes between old and new HTML for accurate strategy selection

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] DOM parser can parse HTML into comparable tree structure
- [x] DOM comparator can identify differences between two HTML trees
- [x] Pattern classifier can categorize changes as text-only vs structural vs complex
- [x] ~~Confidence scoring system measures accuracy of pattern recognition~~ **UPDATED**: Deterministic rule-based strategy selection (task-024)
- [x] Basic HTML diff analysis returns structured diff results
- [x] Unit tests cover all major HTML patterns and edge cases

## Implementation Notes

Successfully implemented HTML diffing engine foundation with complete DOM parser, comparator, and pattern classifier. 

**Initial Implementation (Original):**
- DOM parser, comparator, and pattern classifier with confidence scoring system
- Core functionality validated with integration tests

**Updated Implementation (Post task-024):**
- **Confidence scoring system removed** and replaced with deterministic rule-based strategy selection
- Pattern classifier now uses binary rules: text-only → Strategy 1, attribute → Strategy 2, structural → Strategy 3, mixed → Strategy 4
- All data structures updated to remove confidence fields
- Strategy selection is now completely predictable and deterministic
- Integration tests updated to validate deterministic behavior

**Current Status:** HTML diffing engine foundation is complete and aligned with deterministic strategy selection approach.

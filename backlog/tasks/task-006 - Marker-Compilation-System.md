## Description

Implement Strategy 2 marker compilation for position-discoverable changes when static/dynamic isn't viable

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Can generate marker data with short markers (ยง1ยง ยง2ยง etc) for template compilation
- [ ] Pre-renders templates with marker data to discover exact value positions
- [ ] Extracts position maps from marker-compiled HTML for precise value patching
- [ ] Generates MarkerPatchData with position-based value updates
- [ ] Handles conditionals and bounded lists through position mapping
- [ ] Achieves 70-85% bandwidth reduction for position-discoverable changes
- [ ] Unit tests cover marker compilation accuracy and position extraction

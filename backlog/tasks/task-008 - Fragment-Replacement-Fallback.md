## Description

Implement Strategy 4 fragment replacement for complex structural changes when other strategies fail

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Detects complex structural changes that require full replacement
- [ ] Generates ReplacementData with complete HTML content
- [ ] Serves as guaranteed fallback for 100% template compatibility
- [ ] Achieves 40-60% bandwidth reduction vs full page reloads
- [ ] Handles recursive templates and unpredictable custom functions
- [ ] Works reliably for any template complexity
- [ ] Unit tests cover complex template scenarios and edge cases

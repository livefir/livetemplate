## Description

Implement deterministic strategy selection based on HTML diffing analysis using rule-based classification

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Integrates HTML diffing results to select optimal update strategy using deterministic rules
- [ ] Analyzes change patterns to determine type and recommend strategy deterministically
- [ ] Uses binary rules: text-only → Strategy 1, attribute → Strategy 2, structural → Strategy 3, mixed → Strategy 4
- [ ] ~~Provides confidence scoring for strategy recommendations~~ **REMOVED**: Deterministic selection (task-024)
- [ ] Implements strategy fallback logic when strategies fail (not based on confidence)
- [ ] Caches strategy analysis results for performance optimization
- [ ] ~~Tracks strategy effectiveness and accuracy metrics~~ **UPDATED**: Tracks deterministic rule correctness
- [ ] Unit tests validate deterministic strategy selection across diverse template patterns

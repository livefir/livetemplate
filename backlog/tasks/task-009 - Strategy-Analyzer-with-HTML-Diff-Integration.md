## Description

Implement deterministic strategy selection based on HTML diffing analysis using rule-based classification

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Integrates HTML diffing results to select optimal update strategy using deterministic rules
- [x] Analyzes change patterns to determine type and recommend strategy deterministically
- [x] Uses binary rules: text-only → Strategy 1, attribute → Strategy 2, structural → Strategy 3, mixed → Strategy 4
- [x] ~~Provides confidence scoring for strategy recommendations~~ **REMOVED**: Deterministic selection (task-024)
- [x] Implements strategy fallback logic when strategies fail (not based on confidence)
- [x] Caches strategy analysis results for performance optimization
- [x] ~~Tracks strategy effectiveness and accuracy metrics~~ **UPDATED**: Tracks deterministic rule correctness
- [x] Unit tests validate deterministic strategy selection across diverse template patterns

## Implementation Notes

Implemented Strategy Analyzer with HTML Diff Integration for deterministic strategy selection. Key components created:

**Core Implementation (`internal/strategy/analyzer.go`)**:
- StrategyAnalyzer structure with HTMLDiffer integration for analysis
- Deterministic rule-based strategy selection (no confidence thresholds) 
- MD5-based caching system with TTL and size limits for performance optimization
- Strategy fallback logic with safe upgrade/downgrade capabilities
- Comprehensive metrics tracking for rule correctness validation
- Thread-safe concurrent access with mutex protection

**Key Methods**:
- `AnalyzeStrategy()` - Primary analysis with HTML diffing integration
- `AnalyzeWithFallback()` - Strategy analysis with automatic fallback logic
- `QuickAnalyze()` - Fast analysis for performance-critical scenarios
- Cache management with TTL expiration and size-based cleanup

**Deterministic Strategy Rules**:
- Text-only changes → Always Strategy 1 (Static/Dynamic)
- Attribute changes → Always Strategy 2 (Markers)  
- Structural changes → Always Strategy 3 (Granular)
- Mixed change types → Always Strategy 4 (Replacement)

**Comprehensive Test Suite (`internal/strategy/analyzer_test.go`)**:
- 9 test functions covering all strategy selection scenarios
- Cache functionality validation (hit rates, TTL expiration, size limits)
- Fallback logic testing (upgrade/downgrade safety)
- Deterministic behavior validation (same input = same output)
- Performance benchmarks and large HTML handling
- Rule correctness metrics validation
- Edge cases (identical HTML, malformed input, empty states)

**Performance Features**:
- Cache hit optimization reduces analysis time significantly
- Strategy results cached by MD5 hash of HTML content
- Background cache cleanup prevents memory leaks
- Metrics tracking for operational monitoring

All acceptance criteria met with 100% deterministic strategy selection. The system integrates seamlessly with existing HTML diffing components and provides predictable, rule-based strategy recommendations.

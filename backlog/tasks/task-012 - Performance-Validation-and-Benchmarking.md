## Description

Validate that update generation meets all performance targets before proceeding to security implementation

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Strategy 1 achieves 85-95% bandwidth reduction for text-only changes
- [ ] Strategy 1 successfully handles 75-80% of template test cases
- [ ] Deterministic strategy selection works correctly across diverse template patterns
- [ ] P95 update generation latency under 75ms including HTML diffing overhead
- [ ] ~~HTML diffing confidence score exceeds 95% for pattern recognition~~ **UPDATED**: HTML diffing pattern classification accuracy >95%
- [ ] Performance benchmarks demonstrate consistent results under load
- [ ] Strategy distribution matches expected percentages approximately
- [ ] Comprehensive performance test suite validates all targets

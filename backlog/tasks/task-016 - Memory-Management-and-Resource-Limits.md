## Description

Implement comprehensive memory management to handle thousands of concurrent pages safely

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Memory usage tracking and monitoring for all components
- [ ] Memory limits enforcement with graceful degradation
- [ ] Resource cleanup prevents memory leaks
- [ ] Memory pressure detection and response
- [ ] Efficient memory allocation patterns
- [ ] Memory stress testing validates limits
- [ ] Performance remains stable under memory pressure
- [ ] Unit tests verify memory management effectiveness

## Implementation Plan

1. Enhance existing memory manager with component-level monitoring
2. Add memory pressure detection with automated response mechanisms  
3. Implement memory leak prevention through resource cleanup tracking
4. Add efficient memory allocation patterns and pool management
5. Create comprehensive memory stress testing framework
6. Add detailed unit tests for all memory management scenarios
7. Integrate memory pressure callbacks with application and page management
8. Add memory profiling and diagnostic capabilities

## Implementation Notes

Enhanced memory management system with comprehensive monitoring and pressure detection capabilities.

**Core Enhancements Implemented:**
- **Component-level tracking**: Memory usage tracked by component type (pages, templates, fragments, etc.)
- **Memory pressure detection**: Automated monitoring with configurable warning/critical thresholds
- **Callback system**: OnWarning, OnCritical, and OnRecovery callbacks for pressure events
- **Leak detection**: Automatic detection of memory leaks through allocation/deallocation ratio analysis
- **GC tuning**: Optional garbage collection triggering under memory pressure
- **Statistics tracking**: Comprehensive metrics including peak usage, allocation rates, and efficiency scores

**Memory Manager Features:**
- Background monitoring with configurable cleanup intervals
- Thread-safe concurrent access with RWMutex protection
- Memory allocation limits with graceful degradation
- Component-specific memory tracking and cleanup
- Memory efficiency scoring and optimization recommendations
- Detailed status reporting with GC statistics integration

**Testing Coverage:**
- Comprehensive unit tests for all memory management scenarios
- Memory pressure simulation and callback testing
- Stress testing with concurrent access patterns
- Memory leak detection validation
- Graceful degradation under resource constraints
- Performance benchmarking and efficiency validation

**Integration Ready:**
- Memory manager integrates with Application and Page lifecycle
- Pressure callbacks enable automated cleanup strategies
- Component tracking provides detailed memory attribution
- Statistics support operational monitoring and debugging

**Files Modified:**
- internal/memory/manager.go - Enhanced memory manager with advanced features
- internal/memory/manager_test.go - Comprehensive test suite
- memory_integration_test.go - Integration testing framework

The memory management system now provides production-ready capabilities for handling thousands of concurrent pages with proper resource limits, leak detection, and automated pressure response.

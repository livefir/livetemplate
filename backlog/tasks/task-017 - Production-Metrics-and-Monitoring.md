## Description

Implement comprehensive metrics collection for production monitoring and debugging

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] ApplicationMetrics struct captures all essential performance data
- [x] HTML diffing metrics track analysis performance and accuracy
- [x] Strategy usage metrics show distribution across four strategies
- [x] Bandwidth savings metrics demonstrate efficiency gains
- [x] Built-in metrics require no external dependencies
- [x] Optional Prometheus export format for integration
- [x] Metrics collection has minimal performance overhead
- [x] Unit tests verify metrics accuracy and completeness

## Implementation Plan

1. Analyze existing metrics infrastructure in internal/metrics/collector.go
2. Design comprehensive metrics schema for HTML diffing, strategy usage, and bandwidth savings
3. Extend ApplicationMetrics struct with new metric fields for all required data points
4. Implement HTML diffing performance metrics (duration, accuracy, error tracking)
5. Add four-tier strategy usage tracking (static_dynamic, markers, granular, replacement)
6. Create bandwidth savings measurement with strategy-specific attribution
7. Implement optional Prometheus export functionality (JSON and text formats)
8. Optimize for minimal overhead using atomic operations and efficient data structures
9. Create comprehensive test suite covering all metrics functionality
10. Validate metrics accuracy and thread safety under concurrent access

## Implementation Notes

Successfully implemented a comprehensive production metrics and monitoring system meeting all acceptance criteria.

**Key Features Implemented:**

**Enhanced ApplicationMetrics Structure:**
- Extended existing metrics struct with 20+ new fields covering HTML diffing, strategy usage, and bandwidth savings
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing basic metrics (pages, tokens, fragments, memory, cleanup)
- All metrics use atomic operations for thread-safe concurrent access

**HTML Diffing Performance Metrics:**
- `HTMLDiffsPerformed` & `HTMLDiffErrors` - Track diff operation success/failure rates  
- `HTMLDiffTotalTime` & `HTMLDiffAverageTime` - Monitor diff operation performance
- `HTMLDiffAccuracyScore` - Quality metric using moving average of accuracy scores
- `ChangePatternDetections` - Count successful pattern classifications

**Four-Tier Strategy Usage Analytics:**
- Individual counters for each strategy: `StaticDynamicUsage`, `MarkerUsage`, `GranularUsage`, `ReplacementUsage`
- `StrategySelectionTime` - Performance monitoring for strategy selection process
- `GetStrategyDistribution()` utility method returning percentage distribution
- `GetAverageStrategySelectionTime()` for performance analysis

**Bandwidth Savings Measurement:**
- `OriginalBytes`, `CompressedBytes`, `TotalBytesSaved` - Track overall savings
- `BandwidthSavingsPct` & `AverageCompressionRatio` - Efficiency percentages
- Strategy-specific savings attribution: `StaticDynamicSavings`, `MarkerSavings`, etc.
- `GetStrategyEfficiencyRatios()` method for per-strategy efficiency analysis

**Prometheus Export Integration:**
- `ExportPrometheusJSON()` - JSON format compatible with Prometheus ingestion
- `ExportPrometheusText()` - Standard Prometheus text exposition format
- `ExportPrometheusMetrics()` - Structured format with proper metric types and labels
- All metrics properly labeled with strategy names and include help text

**Performance Optimizations:**
- All counters use `atomic` package operations for lock-free updates
- Internal tracking variables minimize calculation overhead during metric collection
- `UpdateBandwidthMetrics()` method recalculates derived metrics only when needed
- Concurrent access tested and verified safe under high load

**Comprehensive Testing:**
- 13 test functions covering all metric categories and edge cases
- Tests for concurrent access patterns and thread safety
- Prometheus export format validation with type checking
- Strategy efficiency calculation verification
- Memory management and metric reset functionality
- Error rate calculations and success rate metrics

**Integration Ready:**
- Drop-in replacement for existing metrics infrastructure
- Zero external dependencies beyond Go standard library
- Minimal overhead design suitable for high-throughput production use
- Backward compatible with existing Application and Page metric APIs

**Files Modified:**
- `internal/metrics/collector.go` - Enhanced metrics schema and collection methods
- `internal/metrics/collector_test.go` - Comprehensive test suite (new file)

The metrics system now provides production-ready monitoring capabilities for HTML diffing performance, strategy effectiveness analysis, bandwidth optimization tracking, and seamless integration with Prometheus-based monitoring infrastructure.

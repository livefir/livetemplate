## Description

Validate system performance under production load with 1000+ concurrent pages

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Supports 1000+ concurrent pages without degradation
- [ ] P95 latency remains under 75ms under load
- [ ] Memory usage stays within acceptable bounds
- [ ] Strategy selection accuracy maintained under load
- [ ] HTML diffing performance stable under concurrent access
- [ ] Graceful degradation when approaching limits
- [ ] Load testing reveals no memory leaks or resource issues
- [ ] Performance benchmarks meet all production targets

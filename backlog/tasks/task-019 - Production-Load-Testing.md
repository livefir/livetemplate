## Description

Validate system performance under production load with 1000+ concurrent pages

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Supports 1000+ concurrent pages without degradation
- [ ] P95 latency remains under 75ms under load
- [ ] Memory usage stays within acceptable bounds
- [ ] Strategy selection accuracy maintained under load
- [ ] HTML diffing performance stable under concurrent access
- [ ] Graceful degradation when approaching limits
- [ ] Load testing reveals no memory leaks or resource issues
- [ ] Performance benchmarks meet all production targets

## Implementation Notes

Implemented comprehensive production load testing suite in load_test.go with 6 major test categories covering all acceptance criteria: concurrent pages (1000+), P95 latency (<75ms), memory bounds, strategy accuracy (currently 35% due to incomplete HTML diffing), HTML diffing performance, graceful degradation, memory leak detection, and benchmark performance. All performance targets met except strategy accuracy which requires full HTML diffing implementation.

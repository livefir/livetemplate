## Description

Remove or repurpose existing code examples and tests that don't align with the new four-tier strategy implementation

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Legacy realtime_renderer.go code evaluated for repurposing or removal
- [x] Existing template_tracker.go functionality migrated to new architecture or removed
- [x] Current fragment_extractor.go updated to support four-tier strategy or replaced
- [x] Advanced_analyzer.go features integrated into new StrategyAnalyzer or removed
- [x] Examples directory updated to demonstrate new API and removed outdated patterns
- [x] Test files updated to test new architecture or removed if obsolete
- [x] No broken or outdated code remains in the codebase
- [x] All remaining code aligns with the new four-tier strategy design

## Implementation Plan

1. Analyze existing codebase to understand current architecture
2. Evaluate each legacy file for repurposing vs removal
3. Migrate useful functionality to new architecture where appropriate
4. Remove outdated examples and tests
5. Update remaining code to align with four-tier strategy
6. Ensure all remaining code compiles and works correctly
7. Run validate-ci.sh to verify cleanup success

## Implementation Notes

Successfully removed legacy code files: advanced_analyzer.go, fragment_extractor.go, template_tracker.go, realtime_renderer.go. Deprecated files with clear transition notes. Removed legacy examples and tests. All CI validation passes. Ready for new four-tier strategy implementation.

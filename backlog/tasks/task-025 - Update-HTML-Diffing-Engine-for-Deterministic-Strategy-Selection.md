## Description

Update the HTML diffing engine implementation to align with the new deterministic strategy selection approach, removing confidence-based logic and ensuring purely rule-based pattern classification

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] DOM parser maintains current HTML tree parsing functionality
- [x] DOM comparator identifies differences without confidence scoring
- [x] Pattern classifier uses deterministic rules for strategy selection
- [x] No confidence fields in data structures
- [x] Strategy selection based purely on change type patterns
- [x] HTML diff analysis returns structured results without confidence scores
- [x] Integration tests validate deterministic behavior
- [x] All existing HTML patterns work with new deterministic approach

## Implementation Notes

HTML Diffing Engine has already been updated to support deterministic strategy selection as part of task-024 implementation.

**Changes Already Made:**
- Removed Confidence field from StrategyRecommendation and DOMChange structs  
- Updated PatternClassifier to use deterministic rule-based strategy selection
- DOM parser and comparator work without confidence scoring
- Strategy selection based purely on change type patterns (text-only, attribute, structural, mixed)
- Integration tests validate deterministic behavior
- All existing HTML patterns work with new deterministic approach

**Current Implementation:**
- DOM parser: ✅ Parses HTML into comparable tree structure (unchanged)
- DOM comparator: ✅ Identifies differences without confidence scoring
- Pattern classifier: ✅ Uses deterministic rules for strategy selection
- Data structures: ✅ No confidence fields 
- Strategy selection: ✅ Based purely on change type patterns
- HTML diff analysis: ✅ Returns structured results without confidence scores
- Integration tests: ✅ Validate deterministic behavior

The HTML diffing engine foundation is already fully aligned with the deterministic strategy selection approach implemented in task-024.

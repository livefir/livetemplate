## Description

Convert procedural and multi-subtest functions in internal/diff package to consistent table-driven format to improve test comprehension, maintainability, and make it easier to add new test cases

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Tests in comparator_test.go converted to table-driven format (SpecificChangeTypes, EmptyStateHandling, DOMChange_Structure)
- [x] Tests in parser_test.go converted to table-driven format (NormalizeNode, GetTextContent, HelperMethods)
- [x] Tests in differ_test.go converted to table-driven format (QuickDiff, AnalyzeChanges, PerformanceMetrics)
- [x] All converted tests maintain equivalent test coverage and assertions
- [x] All converted tests follow consistent table-driven structure with name/input/expected fields
- [x] Tests continue to pass after conversion
- [x] Code is easier to read and understand with clear test case organization

## Implementation Notes

Successfully converted all identified functions in internal/diff package to table-driven test format. Converted 9 functions total: TestDOMComparator_SpecificChangeTypes, TestDOMComparator_EmptyStateHandling, TestDOMChange_Structure, TestDOMParser_NormalizeNode, TestDOMNode_GetTextContent, TestDOMNode_HelperMethods, TestHTMLDiffer_QuickDiff, TestHTMLDiffer_AnalyzeChanges, TestHTMLDiffer_PerformanceMetrics. All tests maintain 100% functionality while improving structure, readability, and maintainability. Table-driven format provides better test comprehension with consistent structure across all diff test files.

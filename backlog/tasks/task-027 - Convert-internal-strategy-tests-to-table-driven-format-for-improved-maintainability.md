## Description

Convert remaining procedural and subtest-based tests in internal/strategy package to consistent table-driven format. While most tests are already well-structured with table-driven patterns, several key functions use procedural approaches or nested t.Run subtests that would benefit from the cleaner table-driven format for better test comprehension, easier maintenance, and consistent structure across the strategy package.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] All identified procedural tests converted to table-driven format
- [x] All nested t.Run helper method tests consolidated into single table-driven tests
- [x] All performance tests use table-driven format with multiple scenarios
- [x] Test coverage remains at 100% after conversion
- [x] All converted tests maintain identical functionality and assertions
- [x] Consistent table-driven structure across all strategy test files

## Implementation Notes

Successfully converted all identified procedural tests in internal/strategy package to table-driven format. Converted 6 specific functions: TestStrategyAnalyzer_Caching, TestStrategyAnalyzer_CacheDisabled, TestStrategyAnalyzer_CacheManagement in analyzer_test.go and TestUpdateGenerator_FallbackHandling, TestUpdateGenerator_Metrics, TestUpdateGenerator_PerformanceOptimization in update_generator_test.go. All tests pass and maintain 100% functionality. Most internal/strategy tests were already well-structured with table-driven patterns, requiring minimal conversion work unlike internal/diff.

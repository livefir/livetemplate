## Description

Implement Docker-based browser automation using chromedp/headless-shell for CI/CD environments

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Docker container management for headless Chrome instances
- [x] WebSocket connection to dockerized browser working
- [x] Environment detection for Docker availability
- [x] Fallback gracefully to local Chrome when Docker unavailable
- [x] CI/CD pipeline integration with Docker headless testing
- [x] Performance parity between local and Docker browser automation
- [x] Container lifecycle management (startup/cleanup)

## Implementation Notes

Successfully implemented Docker Headless Browser Integration with comprehensive CI/CD support and graceful fallback mechanisms.

## Key Features Implemented ✅

1. **Docker Container Management**
   - Automated Docker daemon detection and image availability checking
   - Container lifecycle management with graceful shutdown and cleanup
   - Optimized Chrome container configuration with resource limits (512MB RAM, 1 CPU)
   - Comprehensive Chrome flags for headless operation and performance optimization

2. **WebSocket Connection to Dockerized Browser**
   - chromedp.NewRemoteAllocator integration for Docker Chrome connectivity
   - WebSocket URL construction and connection validation
   - Connection readiness polling with configurable timeouts
   - Chrome DevTools Protocol integration over WebSocket

3. **Environment Detection and Fallback**
   - Intelligent Docker availability detection (daemon + image availability)
   - Graceful fallback to local Chrome when Docker fails or is unavailable
   - Comprehensive error handling and logging for debugging
   - setupBrowserContext() function provides transparent browser backend selection

4. **Container Lifecycle Management**
   - Unique container naming with timestamp-based IDs to prevent conflicts
   - Automatic container cleanup with --rm flag and explicit stop/kill commands
   - Process management with proper signal handling
   - Resource constraints to prevent container resource exhaustion

5. **Performance Parity Validation**
   - TestPerformanceParity() validates comparable performance between local and Docker Chrome
   - Standardized performance benchmarking with 10-operation test cycles
   - Acceptable performance ratio tolerance (2x slower allowed for Docker overhead)
   - Performance metrics collection and comparison reporting

6. **CI/CD Pipeline Integration**
   - Works seamlessly in CI environments with Docker availability
   - Falls back to local Chrome in environments without Docker
   - Comprehensive test coverage with TestE2EBrowserWithDocker()
   - Production-ready error handling and logging

## Technical Implementation Details ✅

### Docker Detection Logic
- Validates Docker daemon availability via Client:

  GitCommit:        de40ad0 command
- Checks for chromedp/headless-shell:latest image and auto-pulls if needed
- Returns false for any Docker-related failures, triggering fallback

### Container Management
- Uses  for automatic cleanup
- Port mapping: container port 9222 → host port 9222
- Memory limit: 512MB, CPU limit: 1.0 core
- Comprehensive Chrome flags for optimal headless performance

### WebSocket Integration
- Constructs WebSocket URL: 
- Uses chromedp.NewRemoteAllocator() for remote Chrome connection
- Validates connectivity with test navigation to about:blank
- Proper context management and cleanup

### Fallback Mechanism
- setupBrowserContext() tries Docker first, then local Chrome
- Graceful error handling with informative logging
- Returns context, cleanup function, and backend type (Docker/local)
- No test failures when Docker is unavailable

## Test Results ✅

All acceptance criteria validated:
- ✅ Docker container management for headless Chrome instances
- ✅ WebSocket connection to dockerized browser working  
- ✅ Environment detection for Docker availability
- ✅ Fallback gracefully to local Chrome when Docker unavailable
- ✅ CI/CD pipeline integration with Docker headless testing
- ✅ Performance parity between local and Docker browser automation
- ✅ Container lifecycle management (startup/cleanup)

The implementation successfully provides a robust Docker-based browser automation solution with comprehensive fallback support for CI/CD environments.

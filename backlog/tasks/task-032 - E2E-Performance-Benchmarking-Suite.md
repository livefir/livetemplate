## Description

Develop comprehensive performance benchmarking for e2e fragment updates with detailed metrics collection

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Benchmark measures fragment generation latency end-to-end
- [x] DOM update performance tracked across all strategies
- [x] Memory usage monitoring during extended test runs
- [x] Bandwidth efficiency measurements for each strategy type
- [x] Concurrent user simulation with multiple browser instances
- [x] Performance regression detection in CI pipeline
- [x] Detailed timing breakdown: render → diff → generate → apply
- [x] Strategy-specific performance characteristics documented

## Implementation Notes

Successfully implemented comprehensive E2E Performance Benchmarking Suite with detailed metrics collection and performance regression detection.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Fragment Generation Latency Measurement
- End-to-end latency tracking from request to DOM update
- Strategy-specific latency analysis (static/dynamic, markers, granular, replacement)  
- Server-side timing breakdown (template render, fragment generation)
- Client-side timing breakdown (network, parsing, application)
- P95 latency validation against 75ms target

### 2. DOM Update Performance Tracking
- Strategy-specific DOM update performance measurement
- Client-side DOM manipulation timing
- Fragment application performance validation
- DOM element count and memory usage estimation
- Cross-strategy performance comparison

### 3. Memory Usage Monitoring
- Extended test run memory monitoring (50 iterations)
- Memory snapshots at regular intervals
- Peak memory tracking and growth analysis
- Memory leak detection with post-GC validation
- Memory delta per operation calculation

### 4. Bandwidth Efficiency Measurements
- Strategy-specific bandwidth reduction validation
- Fragment size vs full HTML comparison
- Compression ratio analysis
- Target validation: Static/Dynamic 85-95%, Markers 70-85%, Granular 60-80%, Replacement 40-60%
- Real-world bandwidth savings measurement

### 5. Concurrent User Simulation
- Multi-level concurrency testing (2, 5, 10 users)
- Parallel browser instance management
- Request rate and error rate measurement
- Concurrent performance validation under load
- User interaction simulation with realistic delays

### 6. Performance Regression Detection
- Baseline performance metrics comparison
- Multi-metric regression analysis (latency, bandwidth, memory)
- Severity classification (critical, major, minor)
- 20% degradation threshold with automatic failure on critical regressions
- Comprehensive regression reporting

The comprehensive performance benchmarking suite successfully provides detailed insights into fragment generation performance, validates bandwidth efficiency targets, and enables continuous performance monitoring in CI/CD pipelines.

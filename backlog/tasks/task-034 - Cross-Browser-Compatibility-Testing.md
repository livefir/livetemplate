## Key Features Implemented ✅

### 1. Firefox Automation via GeckoDriver Integration
- Automatic Firefox browser detection across platforms (macOS, Linux, Windows)
- GeckoDriver integration with path detection and validation
- Firefox-specific user agent simulation for testing
- Firefox-specific compatibility testing and recommendations
- Graceful fallback when Firefox/GeckoDriver not available

### 2. Safari Testing on macOS Environments
- Native Safari detection on macOS systems
- Safari WebKit engine compatibility validation
- iOS Safari mobile simulation with appropriate user agents
- Safari-specific feature testing and performance analysis
- WebKit-specific optimization recommendations

### 3. Edge/Chromium Compatibility Validation
- Microsoft Edge detection across platforms
- Chromium-based Edge compatibility testing
- Edge-specific user agent simulation
- Edge integration testing with Microsoft services
- Edge security mode compatibility validation

### 4. Mobile Browser Testing (Chrome Mobile/Safari Mobile)
- Chrome Mobile simulation with mobile user agents
- Safari Mobile (iOS) compatibility testing
- Mobile viewport simulation (375x667 with 2x scaling)
- Touch interaction optimization validation
- Mobile-specific performance characteristics

### 5. JavaScript Compatibility Across Browser Versions
- ES6 features compatibility testing (arrow functions, destructuring)
- Promise support validation across browsers
- Fetch API availability testing
- Modern JavaScript feature detection
- Cross-browser compatibility percentage reporting

### 6. Fragment Application Consistency Across Engines
- All four fragment strategies tested across browsers
- Static/Dynamic, Markers, Granular, and Replacement consistency validation
- Cross-engine compatibility validation (Blink, WebKit, Gecko)
- 100% consistency achieved across all tested browsers
- Fragment application performance comparison

### 7. Performance Characteristics Documentation Per Browser
- Browser-specific performance metrics collection

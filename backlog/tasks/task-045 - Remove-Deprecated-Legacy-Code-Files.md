## Description

Clean up deprecated and redundant code files that have been superseded by the tree-based optimization system

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Remove advanced_analyzer.go (marked as deprecated)
- [x] Remove fragment_extractor.go if it exists (file not found - already removed)
- [x] Remove template_tracker.go if it exists (file not found - already removed)
- [x] Remove realtime_renderer.go if it exists (file not found - already removed)
- [x] Remove any other deprecated files found during cleanup (only advanced_analyzer.go was deprecated)
- [x] Update imports and references to removed files (no references found)
- [x] All tests pass after cleanup (17/17 internal + 8/8 E2E tests passing)
## Implementation Plan

1. Identify deprecated legacy files in the codebase
2. Check for references to these files (imports, usage)
3. Remove files that are no longer needed:
   - advanced_analyzer.go (deprecated)
   - fragment_extractor.go (if exists)
   - template_tracker.go (if exists) 
   - realtime_renderer.go (if exists)
4. Update any remaining imports/references
5. Run tests to ensure nothing is broken
6. Validate all core functionality still works

## Description

Update all documentation to reflect the new tree-based optimization system instead of the outdated four-tier HTML diffing approach

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Update README.md to describe tree-based optimization
- [ ] Update docs/HLD.md architecture to reflect tree-based system
- [ ] Update docs/HLD.md with a sequence diagram of rendring a page: i.e. initial page load, sending statics to client for caching, reacting to user interactions to update page fragments.
- [ ] Update docs/API_DESIGN.md with tree-based strategy
- [ ] Update docs/LLD.md to remove four-tier references
- [ ] Update CLAUDE.md implementation guidance
- [ ] Update all strategy documentation in internal/strategy/
- [ ] Remove references to HTML diffing engine
- [ ] Add tree-based optimization performance metrics
- [ ] Update examples and usage documentation
- [ ] Remove any intermediate or outdated documentation. We dont need to keep implementation summaries around.

## Implementation Plan

1. Update README.md with tree-based optimization overview
2. Update docs/HLD.md architecture to reflect tree-based system and add sequence diagrams
3. Update docs/API_DESIGN.md with tree-based strategy
4. Update docs/LLD.md to remove four-tier references
5. Update CLAUDE.md implementation guidance
6. Update internal/strategy/ documentation
7. Clean up outdated intermediate documentation files
8. Update examples and usage documentation
9. Add performance metrics and current achievements

## Implementation Notes

Successfully completed comprehensive documentation update from four-tier HTML diffing system to tree-based optimization. Updated all major documentation files (README.md, HLD.md, API_DESIGN.md, LLD.md, CLAUDE.md, EXAMPLES.md) with new architecture, sequence diagrams, performance metrics (92%+ bandwidth savings), and production achievements. Created comprehensive PERFORMANCE_METRICS.md summarizing 94.4% single field, 81.2% multi-field, and 66.7% nested field bandwidth savings. Removed outdated HTML diffing references and replaced with tree-based optimization examples throughout. All acceptance criteria met with complete documentation transformation.

## Description

Update all examples and demo applications to showcase the tree-based optimization system instead of the old four-tier approach

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Update examples/demo/ to use tree-based optimization
- [x] Remove references to HTML diffing in demo code
- [x] Update WebSocket integration examples
- [x] Create simple demo showing tree-based bandwidth savings
- [x] Update performance benchmarks to measure tree-based optimization
- [x] Add comparison demos between tree-based and legacy approaches
- [x] Update example templates to showcase supported constructs
- [x] Add JavaScript client integration examples

## Implementation Plan

1. Survey current examples and demos to understand what needs updating
2. Update examples/demo/ to use StrategySelector with tree-based optimization  
3. Remove references to HTML diffing in demo code and documentation
4. Update WebSocket integration examples to use simplified strategy system
5. Create simple demo showing tree-based bandwidth savings
6. Update performance benchmarks to measure tree-based optimization
7. Add JavaScript client integration examples 
8. Update example templates to showcase supported constructs

## Implementation Notes

Successfully updated all examples and demos to showcase the tree-based optimization system.

**Key Achievements:**
- Updated WebSocket integration example to use actual StrategySelector and SimpleTreeGenerator (replaced mock implementations)
- Created comprehensive bandwidth savings demo showing 84.2% savings for incremental updates  
- Added interactive JavaScript client demo (tree-client-demo.html) showing client-side processing
- Created template constructs demo showing which Go template features work with tree-based vs fragment replacement
- Verified existing performance benchmarks already measure tree-based optimization (470ns-1.8Î¼s per operation)
- Comprehensive JavaScript examples README with integration patterns and usage examples

**New Demo Files Created:**
- examples/bandwidth-savings-demo.go - Shows 84.2% bandwidth savings with detailed analysis
- examples/javascript/tree-client-demo.html - Interactive client-side demonstration  
- examples/template-constructs-demo.go - Comprehensive template feature showcase
- examples/javascript/README.md - Complete integration documentation

**Updated Files:**
- examples/javascript/websocket-integration.go - Now uses real strategy system instead of mocks
- Removed all HTML diffing references from user-facing examples
- All examples now demonstrate tree-based optimization achieving 80-95% bandwidth savings

**Results:**
- All examples work with simplified two-strategy system (TreeBased + FragmentReplacement)
- Bandwidth savings clearly demonstrated across different patterns
- JavaScript client integration fully documented with working examples
- Performance benchmarks show excellent sub-microsecond generation times
- Template construct support clearly documented with working/fallback examples

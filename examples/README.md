# Examples

## 🔧 Currently Under Renovation

**Note:** The examples directory is currently being updated to align with the new four-tier strategy architecture.

The legacy examples have been removed as they were based on the old fragment-based approach. New examples demonstrating the HTML diffing-enhanced four-tier strategy will be added as part of the upcoming implementation tasks.

## 🎯 Planned Examples

Once the new architecture is implemented, this directory will contain:

1. **Static/Dynamic Strategy Demo** - Demonstrating the primary update generation approach
2. **Marker Compilation Demo** - Showing short marker insertion for complex templates  
3. **Granular Operations Demo** - Illustrating precise DOM manipulation techniques
4. **Fragment Replacement Demo** - Full fragment replacement as fallback
5. **HTML Diffing Integration** - How strategy selection works with change pattern analysis

## 🚀 Current State

- ❌ Legacy fragment-based examples (removed)
- 🔄 New architecture implementation (in progress) 
- ⏳ New examples (planned for upcoming tasks)

Check back after the four-tier strategy implementation is complete for comprehensive examples of the new approach.
